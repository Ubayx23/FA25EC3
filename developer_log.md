# Developer Log

- 12/07 
  - Set up the repo today and fixed some 
  CMakeLists.txt(configuration) issues. Looked through the assignment and 
  main.cpp to understand the task. I make it out to be that im
  making the foundation of the story and connecting nodes
  to one another. Also for future notice, remember to ensure
  the nodes are pointed somewhere. RE-did the 
  node structure in tree.h as it was calling for string
  and U instead of int and T. Still understanding the layout
  so I just added a map in the Tree class for storing nodes.
  No logic today, hoping to add that tmr.
